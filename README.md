## General Information
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:
 
| Gesture | Corresponding Action |
| --- | --- | 
| Thumbs Up | Increase the volume. |
| Thumbs Down | Decrease the volume. |
| Left Swipe | 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds. |
| Right Swipe | 'Jump' forward 10 seconds. |
| Stop | Pause the movie. |

Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images).

## Conclusions
After exicution all model's get the best model is  CNN+LSTM based model as the final choice due to fairly decent accuracy.
